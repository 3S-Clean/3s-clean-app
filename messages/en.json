It’s easy to film someone’s home without them ever knowing — we do it openly so you know what is actually going on, even when you’re not there. We do not share any private information about you or your home. Videos are stored on a secure server with access restricted to authorized personnel for up to 7 days and then deleted."

Individual cleaners are cheaper until something goes wrong. And with us you can deduct up to 20% of your cleaning expenses from your taxes according to §35a EStG."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why are your prices higher than what private cleaners charge?",
            "answer": "Private cleaners pay no taxes and typically have no insurance or liability coverage. We provide trained, vetted staff, insurance coverage, guaranteed appointments and replacements. You’re paying for stability and peace of mind — not for luck. You can also save up to 20% of your cleaning expenses with us according to §35a EStG."

          {
            "question": "We’ve had cleaners before and quality was inconsistent — how are you different?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Can I cancel my appointment anytime?",
            "answer": "Yes — flexibility is part of the service. You can cancel free of charge no later than 48 hours prior. Cancellations later than that (unless a proven emergency) will be charged €50 — we value your trust and time and expect the same in return."

            "answer": "If your home hasn’t been professionally cleaned for more than 1 month, we suggest starting with a heavy-duty clean. After that, we recommend standard cleaning every 7–10 days to keep your home pristine. Every 2–3 months we suggest add-ons like window or oven cleaning. Simply book a consultation."

      "title": "Home cleaning redefined",
      "lead": "The home-cleaning market seems to be stuck in the past: clients fear something can go horribly wrong with their home without supervision, pricing is often a mystery, and cleaners sometimes get treated like disposable labor.",
      "cardTitle": "That is why 3S-Clean is designed not to “compete.” We’re here to reset the standard.",
      "cardBody": "3S-Clean is a premium cleaning service built on one simple belief: if you’re letting someone into your home, you deserve clarity — on quality, on safety, and on fairness. And the person performing the service deserves respect and security."
    },
    "story": {
      "title": "The vision behind 3S",
      "p1": "The architect of the 3S-Clean concept moved to Germany in 2022. Like many newcomers, he had to fight for stability: changing his life-long habits, building trust, making new connections, and becoming an active, contributing member in a new society.",
      "p2": "What helped him stay grounded was something surprisingly simple: cleaning his own home. He enjoys the process — because it’s honest work, it shows results, and it restores control when everything else may feel uncertain. But to most people home cleaning is a black box: they do not have the time, do not know where to start, and are reluctant to hire help.",
      "p3": "But what if one could incorporate technology into the process and open it up? That is how the idea of 3S-Clean was conceived."

      {
        "title": "The visibility and accountability gap",
        "description": "Most clients have no idea what happens during a cleaning session unless they sit there and watch. We introduced video documentation to solve the biggest problem in this industry: trust. You can watch a live stream or review afterward. No guessing. No awkward questions and conversations. No blind faith, but reporting you can trust. "
      },
      {
        "title": "The pricing mess",
        "description": "Most cleaning service providers charge per hour, which sounds simple — until it isn't. Clients often feel like they end up paying for time, not value. We're moving away from vague time-based logic toward clearly defined work scopes, backed by proof and consistency so pricing becomes understandable. And our clients can also save on cleaning expenses: up to 20% through tax reduction according to §35a EStG."
      },
      {
        "title": "Unfair working conditions",
        "description": "A lot of cleaning happens in a gray zone. Cleaners have no security. Odd cash jobs mean no pensions, no proper medical coverage, no stability. That's not \"efficient\" — that is broken. Our model is built to support real employment, training, and long-term working dignity because quality and fairness scale together."
