            "question": "Why should I hire a company instead of paying privately cheaper in cash?",
            "answer": "Because you are protected. Our services are insured. We are always accountable. We don’t disappear if anything gets damaged — it’s our cost, never yours. Individual cleaners are cheaper until something goes wrong. And with us you can deduct up to 20% of your cleaning expenses from your taxes according to §35a EStG."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why are your prices higher than what private cleaners charge?",
            "answer": "Private cleaners pay no taxes and typically have no insurance or liability coverage. We provide trained, vetted staff, insurance coverage, guaranteed appointments and replacements. You’re paying for stability and peace of mind — not for luck. You can also save up to 20% of your cleaning expenses with us according to §35a EStG."

            "question": "Do I get the same cleaner every time?",
            "answer": "We generally assign a dedicated cleaner for recurring appointments. You build trust, we deliver consistency. If at any time you want to change the cleaner — just contact us at least 48 hours in advance."
          },
          {
            "question": "We’ve had cleaners before and quality was inconsistent — how are you different?",

            "question": "Can I cancel my appointment anytime?",
            "answer": "Yes — flexibility is part of the service. You can cancel free of charge no later than 48 hours prior. Cancellations later than that (unless a proven emergency) will be charged €50 — we value your trust and time and expect the same in return."

After that, we recommend standard cleaning every 7–10 days to keep your home pristine. Every 2–3 months we suggest add-ons like window or oven cleaning. Simply book a consultation."
