- Payment & invoicing data (payment method, invoice data, transaction references)
- Technical usage data (IP address, device/browser data, logs)
- Video & audio data for service documentation/livestreaming (if booked)

## 3. Purposes of Processing
- Contract performance and booking management

- Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract)
- Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR (legal obligation, e.g. tax law)
- Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests: security, fraud prevention, legal claims, quality)
- Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent, where required, e.g. analytics/marketing)

## 5. Video Recording & Livestreaming
If booked, we record/livestream footage for transparency, quality control, evidence and employee safety.

**Scope limits:**
- only within the booked service scope
- no filming inside drawers/wardrobes/containers unless explicitly requested
- we avoid personal documents/photos/sensitive items where reasonably possible

**Access:** secure, individual, time-limited links and role-based access control.  
**Hosting/processing:** via specialised video hosting providers acting as processors (Art. 28 GDPR). No automated decision-making or profiling (Art. 22 GDPR).  
**Retention:** standard retention is 7 business days after service completion; then automatic, irreversible deletion. Retention may be extended for disputes or legal obligations.

**Advertising use:** only anonymised clips (e.g., blurring faces, documents, addresses, licence plates). If anonymisation is not feasible, we obtain separate explicit consent.

## 6. Payment Processing (Stripe)
We use external payment service providers (e.g. Stripe).
We do not store full card or bank account details on our systems; we typically receive only confirmations and references required for accounting and invoicing.
Payment data is processed by the payment provider according to applicable security standards (e.g. PCI-DSS).

## 7. Cookies & Google Analytics
We use cookies and similar technologies.

**Strictly necessary cookies:** for login/sessions, security, language preferences, and booking/payment flows.  
Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR and §25(2) No. 2 TTDSG.

**Google Analytics:** only with your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR in conjunction with §25(1) TTDSG). IP anonymisation is enabled. You can withdraw consent at any time via cookie settings.

## 8. Recipients / Processors
We use service providers as processors (Art. 28 GDPR), e.g. for hosting/cloud, email/communication, payments, video hosting, and analytics. They are contractually bound to confidentiality and security.

## 9. Transfers Outside the EU/EEA
Where data is processed outside the EU/EEA (e.g. in connection with analytics), this is done only with appropriate safeguards (e.g. adequacy decision, EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or Standard Contractual Clauses – SCCs).

## 10. Retention Periods
- Account data: while the account exists
- Booking/invoice data: up to 10 years (statutory tax retention)
- Video footage: 7 business days (may be longer for disputes/legal obligations)

## 11. Your Rights
You have the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, objection, and withdrawal of consent. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
