# Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** [DD Month YYYY]

## 1. Scope
These Terms apply to home cleaning and related services provided to consumers in Germany. Mandatory consumer protection rules apply and prevail over conflicting clauses.

## 2. Contract Formation
A contract is formed when we confirm your booking in text form (e.g., email, SMS, WhatsApp) or in your account. The version provided at the time of booking applies.

## 3. Services
Scope is determined by the booked package and agreed add-ons. We may reasonably decide the order and method of cleaning.

Unless explicitly agreed, services do not include hazardous waste, mold remediation, pest control, construction/renovation work, disinfection under infection-control standards, laundering/ironing, or moving heavy furniture (>15 kg).

If you request use of your own products/equipment, we are not liable for defects or incompatibilities of those items.

## 4. Personnel
We select assigned personnel at our discretion; you have no claim to a specific cleaner. In exceptional cases we may use selected subcontractors. We remain your contractual partner and responsible for proper performance.

## 5. Client Duties
Provide safe working conditions and access (water/electricity/lighting; Wi-Fi if livestreaming is used). Secure valuables and fragile items before the service begins. Secure pets so cleaners can work safely. Provide accurate booking information (size, condition, access, parking, special requirements).

## 6. Prices and Adjustments
Prices are based on information provided at booking. If information is materially incorrect, we may reasonably adjust the price or scope, or refuse performance if unreasonable. You may prove that no damage or a significantly lower damage occurred (where applicable).

## 7. Access and Cancellation
You must allow access during the agreed time window. We may wait up to 20 minutes where reasonable. Cancellations/no-access may incur a reasonable fee. You may prove that no damage or a significantly lower damage occurred.

## 8. Video (if booked)
If booked, recording/livestreaming is used for transparency, quality control, evidence and employee safety. Only areas within scope are filmed; no filming inside personal storage unless explicitly requested. Standard retention is 7 business days; longer retention may apply for disputes/legal obligations. See Privacy Policy for details.

## 9. Payment and Invoicing
Payment methods: card and SEPA. No cash payments. Electronic invoices (PDF) are provided via account/email.

## 10. Liability
We are always liable for intent, gross negligence, and injury to life, body or health. For simple negligence, liability is limited to breaches of essential contractual obligations and foreseeable, typical damage. Mandatory statutory liability remains unaffected.

## 11. Withdrawal
Consumers generally have a statutory 14-day right of withdrawal for distance contracts, subject to exceptions. If you request performance to begin within the withdrawal period, your right may expire once the service has been fully performed.

## 12. Miscellaneous
German law applies. Contract language is German; any English version is for convenience only and the German version prevails.
